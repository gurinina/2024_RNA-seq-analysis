# DGE analysis workflow

Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 involves multiple steps as displayed in the flowchart below in blue.

![Alt text](img/DESeq2_workflow_2018.png){ width=600 }

**Full Workflow in DESeq2:**

- **Load Data:** Begin with raw count data (gene expression counts) and sample metadata (information about the experimental conditions).

- **Estimate Size Factors:** Normalize counts across samples to account for differences in sequencing depth or library size, ensuring that comparisons between samples are meaningful.

- **Estimate Gene-Wise Dispersions:** Estimate the dispersion (a measure of variability) for each gene. This represents the variance in counts that cannot be explained by differences in mean expression alone.

- **Fit a Global Trend for Dispersion:** Model the relationship between the mean counts and the dispersion. DESeq2 allows this relationship to be fit either using a parametric model (default) or a non-parametric approach for highly variable genes.

- **Shrink the Gene-Wise Dispersion Estimates:** Shrink the gene-wise dispersion estimates toward the global trend using an empirical Bayes approach. This step stabilizes the estimates, especially for genes with low counts, improving reliability.

- **Fit the Negative Binomial Model:** Use the final shrunken gene-wise dispersion estimates to fit a negative binomial model for each gene. This model captures the counts' variability and provides estimates of log-fold changes in gene expression between conditions.

- **Shrink the Log-Fold Changes:** Optionally shrink the log-fold changes using a regularization technique to stabilize the estimates, especially for low-expression genes.

- **Perform Statistical Testing:** Conduct statistical tests to identify genes that are differentially expressed between conditions. DESeq2 uses a Wald test to assess the significance of the log-fold changes and provides adjusted p-values to account for multiple testing.

This final step in the differential expression analysis workflow of fitting the raw counts to the **NB model** and performing the statistical test for differentially expressed genes, is the step we care about. This is the step that determines whether the mean expression levels of different sample groups are significantly different.

Although the [DESeq2 paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8) was published in 2014, but the package is continually updated and available for use in R through Bioconductor. 

## Running DESeq2

Prior to performing the differential expression analysis, it is a good idea to know what **sources of variation** are present in your data, either by exploration during the QC and/or prior knowledge. **Sources of variation** refer to anything that causes differences in gene expression across your samples, including **biological factors** (**treatment**, **sex**, **age**) and **technical factors** (**batch effects**, **sequencing depth**). Ideally, these are all factors in you metadata. These factors lead to variability in the data and can affect your ability to detect meaningful biological signals (like differential expression between **treated** and **control** samples).Once you know the major sources of variation, you can remove them prior to analysis or control for them in the statistical model by including them in your **design formula**.

### Set the Design Formula

The main purpose of the **design formula** in DESeq2 is to specify the factors that are influencing gene expression so that their effects can be **accounted for** or **controlled** during the analysis. This allows DESeq2 to isolate the effect of the variable you're primarily interested in while adjusting for other known sources of variation. The design formula should have all of the factors in your metadata that account for major sources of variation in your data. The last factor entered in the formula should be the condition of interest.

The design formula allows you to include multiple variables that might affect gene expression, so that DESeq2 can:

- **Adjust for known sources of variation** (e.g., **batch effects**, **sex**, **age**, etc.)

- **Test the factor of interest** (e.g., **treatment**) after adjusting for these confounders.

For example, let's look at the design formula for our count matrix:
```{r}
design(dds)
```

**Example**
Suppose you have metadata that includes **sex**, **age**, and **treatment** as shown below:

![Alt text](img/meta_example.png){ width=300 }

If you want to examine differences in gene expression between **treatment** conditions, and you know that **sex** and **age** are major sources of variation, your design formula would look like this:

`design <- ~ sex + age + treatment`

The design formula is specified using the tilde (~) symbol in R, with the factors of interest separated by plus (+) signs. The formula structure tells DESeq2 which known sources of variation to control for during the analysis, as well as the factor of interest to test for differential expression. 

**Why is this important?**

By including known sources of variation (such as **sex** and **age**) in the design, DESeq2 can adjust for their effects, ensuring that any differences observed in gene expression are due to the biological condition of interest (in this case, **treatment**) and not confounded by other factors like **sex** or **age**. The comparison between **treatment** and **control** is still performed in the `results()` function, but it now accounts for these additional factors. This allows DESeq2 to isolate the effect of the variable you're primarily interested in (e.g., **treatment**) while adjusting for other known sources of variation (e.g., **sex**, **age**).

**To figure out the design formula, follow these steps:**

1. Identify your factor of interest (e.g., **treatment**).
2. Determine any confounding variables you need to adjust for (e.g., **sex**, **age**)
3. Write the formula, placing the factor of interest last.
4. Explore your metadata with **PCA** to ensure all relevant factors are included.

### MOV10 Differential Expression Analysis

Now that we understand how to specify the model in DESeq2, we can proceed with running the differential expression pipeline on the raw count data.

**Running Differential Expression in Two Lines of Code**

To obtain differential expression results from our raw count data, we only need to run two lines of code!

First, we create a DESeqDataSet, as we did in the ['Count normalization'](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/02_DGE_count_normalization.html#2-create-deseq2-object) lesson, specifying the location of our raw counts and metadata, and applying our design formula:

```{r}
## Create DESeq object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = data, colData = meta, design = ~ sampletype)
```

Next, we run the actual differential expression analysis with a single call to the `DESeq()` function. This function handles everything—from **normalization** to **linear** modeling—all in one step. During execution, `DESeq2` will print messages detailing the steps being performed: estimating size factors, estimating dispersions, gene-wise dispersion estimates, modeling the mean-dispersion relationship, and statistical testing for differential expression.

```{r}
## Run analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

By re-assigning the result to back to the same variable name (`dds`), we update our `DESeqDataSet` object, which will now contain the results of each step in the analysis, effectively filling in the `slots` of our `DESeqDataSet` object.

## DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis workflow

With these two lines of code, we have completed the core steps in the DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis. The key steps in this workflow are summarized below:

![Alt text](img/deseq2_workflow_separate.png){ width=200 }

In the following sections, we will explore each step in detail to better understand how DESeq2 performs the statistical analysis and what metrics we should focus on to evaluate the quality of the results.

### Step 1: Estimate size factors

The first step in the differential expression analysis is to estimate the size factors, which is exactly what we already did to normalize the raw counts. 

![Alt text](img/deseq2_workflow_separate_sf.png){ width=200 }

DESeq2 will automatically estimate the size factors when performing the differential expression analysis. However, if you have already generated the size factors using `estimateSizeFactors()`, as we did earlier, then `DESeq2` will use these values.

To normalize the count data, `DESeq2` calculates size factors for each sample using the *median of ratios method* discussed previously in the Count normalization (Chapter \@ref(count-normalization)) lesson.

#### MOV10 DE analysis: examining the size factors

Let's take a quick look at size factor values we have for each sample:

```{r}
## Check the size factors
sizeFactors(dds)

```
 
Take a look at the total number of reads for each sample:

```{r}
## Total number of raw counts per sample
colSums(counts(dds))
```

*How do the numbers correlate with the size factor?*

### Step 2: Estimate gene-wise dispersion

The next step in differential expression analysis is estimating gene-wise dispersions. Before diving into the details of how DESeq2 estimates these values, it’s important to understand what dispersion means in the context of RNA-Seq analysis.

**What is Dispersion?**

Dispersion measures the variability in gene expression that cannot be explained by differences in the mean expression level alone. It captures the extra-Poisson variability observed in RNA-Seq data, where the variance tends to exceed the mean due to both biological and technical factors.

Dispersion in DESeq2 reflects the variability in gene expression for a given mean count and is inversely related to the mean and directly related to the variance:

- Genes with lower mean counts tend to have higher dispersion (more variability).

- Genes with higher mean counts tend to have lower dispersion (less variability).

The plot below shows the relationship between mean and variance in gene expression. Each black dot represents a gene. Notice that for genes with higher mean counts, the variance can be predicted more reliably, whereas genes with lower mean counts exhibit more variability, leading to more spread in their dispersion estimates.

![Alt text](img/deseq_mean_vs_variance.png){ width=600 }

**How Does Dispersion Relate to the Model?**

In DESeq2, dispersion ($\alpha$) captures the variability in counts beyond what is expected based on the mean. It helps model the biological variability between replicates within the same experimental condition. However, with small sample sizes (e.g., 3-6 replicates per group), gene-specific estimates of dispersion can be unreliable, particularly for genes with similar mean counts but differing variances.

To improve accuracy, DESeq2 shares information across genes with similar expression levels through a process called **shrinkage**, assuming that genes with similar mean expression tend to have similar dispersion.

**Variance Formula and Its Importance**

In the negative binomial model used by DESeq2, the variance for each gene \( i \) in sample \( j \) is given by:

$$Var(Y_{ij})  = {\mu_{ij} + \alpha_{i}}{\mu_{ij}^2}$$
Where:

- \( Var(Y_{ij}) is the variance for gene \( i \) in sample \( j \).

- \( \mu_{ij}\) is the mean expression level for gene \( i \) in sample \( j \).

- \( \alpha_{i}\) is the gene-specific dispersion parameter.


![Alt text](img/deseq2_workflow_separate_dis.png){ width=200 }

**How DESeq2 Models Dispersion Using the Negative Binomial Distribution**

DESeq2 models RNA-Seq count data using the negative binomial (NB) distribution, which effectively handles overdispersion—a common feature of biological data where the variance exceeds the mean. The two primary parameters of the NB model are the mean expression level and the dispersion, which respectively capture the expected gene counts and the variability across replicates.

For each gene \( i \), the observed count $Y_{ij}$ in sample \( j \)  is modeled as:

$$
Y_{ij} \sim \text{NB}\left(\mu_{ij}, \alpha_{i}\right)
$$
Where:

- \( Y_{ij}\) is the observed count for gene \( i \) in sample \( j \)

- \( \mu_{ij}\) ​
  is the expected normalized count for gene \( i \) in sample \( j \). 
**Estimating the dispersion for each gene separately:**

DESeq2 uses the negative binomial (NB) distribution to model count data in RNA-Seq experiments. The NB distribution accounts for the overdispersion commonly observed in real biological data, where the variance exceeds the mean. The two key parameters of the NB distribution are the mean expression level and the dispersion.

The first step in estimating dispersion is to obtain dispersion estimates for each gene. The dispersion parameter for each gene is estimated through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This method seeks to find the value of $\alpha_{i}$ that maximizes the likelihood of observing the counts $Y_{ij}$, given the model. In other words, MLE identifies the $\alpha_{i}$ that best explains the observed variability for gene $i$.

### Step 3: Fit Curve to Gene-Wise Dispersion Estimates

Once DESeq2 has estimated the initial gene-wise dispersions ($\alpha_{i}$) using maximum likelihood, the next step is to fit a global trend to model how dispersion typically changes as a function of the mean expression ($\mu_{i}$) across all genes and samples. This allows DESeq2 to borrow strength from the overall dataset and stabilize the dispersion estimates, especially for genes with low counts or high variability.

**Fitting the Global Dispersion Trend**

The global trend models the general relationship between gene expression and dispersion. In RNA-Seq data, genes with low mean expression typically show greater variability (higher dispersion), while genes with high expression tend to be more stable (lower dispersion). By fitting this trend, DESeq2 smooths out gene-specific variability and provides better estimates of dispersion for all genes.

The global trend represents the expected dispersion value for genes at different expression levels. While individual genes may have varying biological variability, there is a consistent relationship across all genes between expression and dispersion. Fitting a curve to this data ensures that the dispersion estimates are more accurate.

**Why is this important?**

- **Lowly expressed genes** tend to show more variability across replicates, making dispersion estimates noisy.

- **Highly expressed genes** have more stable counts, with lower dispersion.

By fitting a curve to capture this general trend, DESeq2 ensures that **genes with low counts** or **high variability** have more reliable dispersion estimates.

**Visual representation of the global dispersion trend:**

The red line in the plot below shows the global trend, which represents the expected dispersion value for genes of a given expression level. Each black dot corresponds to a gene, plotted with its mean expression and initial dispersion estimate from maximum likelihood estimation (Step 2).

### Step 4: Shrinking Gene-Wise Dispersion Estimates Toward the Global Trend

After fitting the global trend, DESeq2 applies empirical Bayes shrinkage to the individual gene-wise dispersion estimates, pulling them toward the curve. Empirical Bayes shrinkage is a statistical technique used to stabilize parameter estimates by borrowing information across the entire dataset. This process helps reduce the noise in the estimates, particularly for genes with low counts.

- **Low-count genes** with more uncertain dispersion estimates are pulled closer to the global trend. 

- **Genes with higher counts** or more reliable estimates will be shrunk less.

**Why is shrinkage important?**

Shrinkage improves the **reliability of dispersion estimates** by making them more stable, especially for genes with **low or moderate counts**, where the estimates are typically noisier. This ensures that dispersion estimates are not overly influenced by random fluctuations and are more accurate for downstream differential expression testing.

Shrinkage is crucial for **reducing false positives** in differential expression analysis. Genes with low or moderate dispersion estimates are pulled up toward the curve, making the estimates more reliable for subsequent model fitting and differential expression testing.

Genes with **extremely high dispersion values** (potential outliers) and values above the global trend have more variability than expected for their level of mean expression. These genes are often biological outliers (e.g., genes involved in highly dynamic processes) or technical outliers (e.g., affected by sequencing or sample quality issues) and are typically not shrunk. These outlier genes are highlighted by blue circles in the plot below:

By shrinking the estimates toward the fitted curve, DESeq2 ensures that the final dispersion estimates are more stable and accurate for differential expression testing.

**Assessing Model Fit with Dispersion Plots**

After shrinkage, it’s important to assess how well the model fits the data. The dispersion plot shows gene-wise dispersions relative to the global trend. Ideally, most genes should scatter around the curve, with dispersions decreasing as mean expression increases.

If you notice unusual patterns, such as a cloud of points far from the curve, this could indicate data quality issues (e.g., outliers, contamination, or problematic samples). Using DESeq2's `plotDispEsts()` function helps visualize the fit of the model and the extent of shrinkage across genes.

**Examples of Problematic Dispersion Plots:**

Below are examples of worrisome dispersion plots that suggest potential issues with data quality or fit:

**Since we have a small sample size, for many genes we see quite a bit of shrinkage. Do you think our data are a good fit for the model?**
