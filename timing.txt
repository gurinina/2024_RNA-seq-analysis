when publish. book gives you error:
Error in if (is.null(application$owner_username) || accountDetails$username ==  :
missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
disconnect bookdown.org in global options and rerun publish book

publish_book(account="ggiaever",name="RNAseq-analsis",server="bookdown.org")

img should be in root directory

koos10.png should be in lessons directory

data should be in root directory

css in main directory

dummy script in lessons and root directory, no heading

will read answers as a chapter even if not in _bookdown.yml

# 3 is correct

1. index in root dir, _bookdown.yml and _output.yml in root directory

bookdown::render_book(input = 'lessons/index.Rmd',config_file = "_bookdown.yml", output_format = "bookdown::gitbook",output_dir = "lessons")

_bookdown.yml and _output.yml have root directory lessons/css

rmd_dir = ["lessons"]

css files were moved
html files were in lessons file
no output
no md files created

2.
bookdown::render_book(input = 'lessons/index.Rmd',config_file = "_bookdown.yml", output_format = "bookdown::gitbook",output_dir = "lessons/_book")

bookdown_files in root dir
_book in lessons

output is rna-seq-workshop.html, which worked, index.html exists but is empty

can't knit dummy script

when I rename rna-seq-workshop.html to index.html, it works

3. bookdown::render_book(input = 'index.Rmd',config_file = "_bookdown.yml", output_format = "bookdown::gitbook")

this worked but i had to give dummy-script a name

worked when I gave back 09
