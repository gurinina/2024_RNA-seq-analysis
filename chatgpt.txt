You're right, and your thinking is aligned with how DESeq2 operates. To clarify:

Key Steps in DESeq2:
Estimation of Size Factors:

Size factors are calculated before the negative binomial (NB) model fitting. They normalize for differences in sequencing depth (library size) across samples, adjusting the raw counts to be comparable between samples.
The size factors are determined by DESeq2 using methods like the median-of-ratios approach, where the counts for each gene are normalized relative to the geometric mean of the counts across samples.
Dispersion Estimation:

After size factor normalization, DESeq2 estimates the dispersion

  for each gene using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The dispersion represents how much the variance exceeds the mean for each gene, which accounts for biological variability across samples.
This step is crucial because RNA-Seq data often exhibit overdispersion (variance greater than the mean), and the dispersion parameter helps adjust the model accordingly.
Model Re-fitting (with Fixed Dispersion):

Once the dispersion estimates are obtained, DESeq2 refits the negative binomial model for each gene, keeping the dispersion estimates fixed.
During this re-fitting process, the focus is on estimating the regression coefficients

The model is fit using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to maximize the likelihood of observing the data given the fixed dispersions.
Clarification:
So, while size factors are used to normalize the data before dispersion estimation, dispersion is the key parameter estimated during model fitting. After the dispersions are estimated, the model is refit, keeping the dispersions fixed, to estimate the regression coefficients

Summary of Steps:
Size Factor Estimation: Normalize for sequencing depth differences (before model fitting).
Dispersion Estimation: Estimate dispersions for each gene using MLE.
Model Re-fitting: Refit the NB model, keeping dispersions fixed, to estimate the log2 fold changes

The size factor plays a role in the normalization process, but the dispersion estimate is the primary component used in the NB model fitting for identifying differential expression.
