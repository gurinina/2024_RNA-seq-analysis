<p><a href="http://genemania.org/">GeneMANIA</a> is a tool for predicting the function of your genes. Rather than looking for enrichment, the query gene set is evaluated in the context of curated functional association data and results are displayed in the form of a network. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. Genes are represented as the nodes of the network and edges are formed by known association evidence. The query gene set is highlighted and so you can find other genes that are related based on the toplogy in the network. This tool is more useful for smaller gene sets (&lt; 400 genes), as you can see in the figure below our input results in a bit of a hairball that is hard to interpret.</p>

<p>Use the significant gene list generated from the analysis we performed in class as input to GeneMANIA. Using only pathway and coexpression data as evidence, take a look at the network that results. Can you predict anything functionally from this set of genes?</p>
