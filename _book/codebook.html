<p>RNA-Seq was performed on HEK293F cells that were either transfected with a <strong>MOV10</strong> transgene, or siRNA to knock down Mov10 expression, or non-specific (irrelevant) siRNA. This resulted in 3 conditions <strong>Mov10 oe</strong> (over expression), <strong>Mov10 kd</strong> (knock down) and <strong>Irrelevant kd</strong>, respectively. The number of replicates is as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="img/dataset.png" width="400"></p>
<p>Using these data, we will evaluate transcriptional patterns associated with perturbation of <strong>MOV10</strong> expression. Please note that the irrelevant siRNA will be treated as our control condition.</p>
<p><strong>Our questions:</strong>
* What patterns of expression can we identify with the loss or gain of MOV10?
* Are there any genes shared between the two conditions?</p>

<p>Note that in the above figure, the variance across replicates tends to be greater than the mean (slope &gt; 1, red line), especially for genes with large mean expression levels. This is a good indication that our data do not fit the Poisson distribution and we need to account for this increase in variance using the Negative Binomial model.</p>

<p>The next step is to normalize the count data in order to be able to make fair gene comparisons between samples.</p>
<p><img src="img/deseq_workflow_normalization_2018.png" width="400"></p>
<p>To perform the <strong>median of ratios method</strong> of normalization, DESeq2 has a single <code>estimateSizeFactors()</code> function that will generate size factors for us. We will use the function in the example below, but <strong>in a typical RNA-seq analysis this step is automatically performed by the <code>DESeq()</code> function</strong>, which we will see later.</p>

<p>By assigning the results back to the dds object we are filling in the slots of the DESeqDataSet object with the appropriate information. We can take a look at the normalization factor applied to each sample using:</p>

##  1.2016082  1.1205912  0.6534987</code></pre>
<p>Now, to retrieve the normalized counts matrix from dds, we use the counts() function and add the argument normalized=TRUE.</p>

<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset (dimensionality reduction). The take home message for our purposes is that <strong>if two samples have similar levels of expression for the genes that contribute significantly to the variation represented by PC1, they will be plotted close together on the PC1 axis.</strong> Therefore, we would expect that biological replicates to have similar scores (since the same genes are changing) and cluster together on PC1 and/or PC2, and the samples from different treatment groups to have different score. This is easiest to understand by visualizing example PCA plots.</p>

<p>Similar to PCA, hierarchical clustering is another, complementary method for identifying strong patterns in a dataset and potential outliers. The heatmap displays the correlation of gene expression for all pairwise combinations of samples in the dataset. Since the majority of genes are not differentially expressed, samples generally have high correlations with each other (values higher than 0.80). Samples below 0.80 may indicate an outlier in your data and/or sample contamination.</p>

Since the majority of genes are not differentially expressed, samples generally have high correlations with each other (values higher than 0.80). Samples below 0.80 may indicate an outlier in your data and/or sample contamination. We expect to see samples clustered similar to the groupings observed in a PCA plot.</p>
<p>We will be using the <code>pheatmap()</code> function from the pheatmap package for heatmaps. This function requires a matrix/dataframe of numeric values as input, and so the first thing we need to is retrieve that information from the rld object:</p>

<p>Dispersion is a measure of spread or variability in the data. DESeq2 uses a specific measure of dispersion (α) related to the mean (μ) and variance of the data: <span class="math inline">\(Var = μ + α*μ^2\)</span>. For genes with moderate to high count values, the square root of dispersion will be equal to the coefficient of variation (<code>σ/ μ</code>). So 0.01 dispersion means 10% variation around the mean expected across biological replicates.</p>
<p>We can make a rough estimate of the gene-wise dispersions using this formula.
We know that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma^2 = {\mu + \alpha*}{\mu^2}\]</span></p>
<p>So the dispersion is equal to:

<p>Now the approximation is pretty good. The larger the value of the mean, the better the approximation.</p>
<p>What does the DESeq2 dispersion represent?</p>
<p>The DESeq2 dispersion estimates are inversely related to the mean and directly related to variance. Based on this relationship, the dispersion is higher for small mean counts and lower for large mean counts.</p>
<p>How does the dispersion relate to our model?</p>
<p>To accurately model sequencing counts, we need to generate accurate estimates of within-group variation (variation between replicates of the same sample group) for each gene. With only a few (3-6) replicates per group, the estimates of variation for each gene are often unreliable (due to the large differences in dispersion for genes with similar means).</p>
<p>To address this problem, DESeq2 shares information across genes to generate more accurate estimates of variation based on the mean expression level of the gene using a method called ‘shrinkage’. DESeq2 assumes that genes with similar expression levels have similar dispersion.</p>
<p>Estimating the dispersion for each gene separately:</p>
<p>To model the dispersion based on expression level (mean counts of replicates), the dispersion for each gene is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed data is most probable. In other words, given the count values of the replicates, the most likely estimate of dispersion is calculated.</p>

<p>The next step in the workflow is to fit a curve to the dispersion estimates for each gene. The idea behind fitting a curve to the data is that different genes will have different scales of biological variability, but, over all genes, there will be a distribution of reasonable estimates of dispersion.</p>

<p>The curve allows for more accurate identification of differentially expressed genes when sample sizes are small, and the strength of the shrinkage for each gene depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>how close gene dispersions are from the curve</li>
<li>sample size (more samples = less shrinkage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dispersion plots are a good way to examine your data to ensure it is a good fit for the DESeq2 model.</p>

<p>To generate more accurate log2 foldchange estimates, DESeq2 allows for the <strong>shrinkage of the LFC estimates toward zero</strong> when the information for a gene is low, which could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low counts</li>
<li>High dispersion values</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the shrinkage of dispersion estimates, LFC shrinkage uses <strong>information from all genes</strong> to generate more accurate estimates. Specifically, the distribution of LFC estimates for all genes is used (as a prior) to shrink the LFC estimates of genes with little information or high dispersion toward more likely (lower) LFC estimates.</p>

<p>With DESeq2, the Wald test is commonly used for hypothesis testing when comparing two groups. A Wald test statistic is computed along with a probability that a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed value were selected at random. This probability is called the p-value of the test. If the p-value is small we reject the null hypothesis and state that there is evidence against the null (i.e. the gene is differentially expressed).</p>

<p>To summarize the results table, a handy function in DESeq2 is <code>summary()</code>. Confusingly it has the same name as the function used to inspect data frames. This function when called with a DESeq results table as input, will summarize the results using the alpha threshold: FDR &lt; 0.05 (padj/FDR is used even though the output says <code>p-value &lt; 0.05</code>).</p>

<p>What we noticed is that the FDR threshold on it's own doesn't appear to be reducing the number of significant genes. With large significant gene lists it can be hard to extract meaningful biological relevance. To help increase stringency, one can also <strong>add a fold change threshold</strong>.</p>

<p>The lfc.cutoff is set to 0.58; remember that we are working with log2 fold changes so this translates to an actual fold change of 1.5 which is pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>We can easily subset the results table to only include those that are significant using the filter() function, but first we will convert the results table into a tibble:</p>

<p>Often it is helpful to check the expression of multiple genes of interest at the same time. This often first requires some data wrangling.</p>
<p>We are going to plot the normalized count values for the <strong>top 20 differentially expressed genes (by padj values)</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that we have the normalized counts for each of the top 20 genes for all 8 samples, to plot using <code>ggplot()</code>, we need to <code>pivot_longer</code> top20_sigOE_norm from a wide format to a long format so the counts for all samples will be in a single column to allow us to give ggplot the one column with the values we want it to plot.</p>
<p>The <code>pivot_longer()</code> function in the <strong>tidyr</strong> package will perform this operation and will output the normalized counts for all genes for <em>Mov10_oe_1</em> listed in the first 20 rows, followed by the normalized counts for <em>Mov10_oe_2</em> in the next 20 rows, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>The above plot would be great to look at the expression levels of a good number of genes, but for more of a global view there are other plots we can draw.

<p>To generate a volcano plot (which you have the log transformed adjusted p-values plotted on the y-axis and log2 fold change values on the x-axis), we first need to have a column in our results data indicating whether or not the gene is considered differentially expressed based on p-adjusted values.</p>

<p>What if we also wanted to know where the top 10 genes (lowest padj) in our DE list are located on this plot? We could label those dots with the gene name on the Volcano plot using <code>geom_text_repel()</code>.</p>
<p>First, we need to order the res_tableOE tibble by padj, and add an additional column to it, to include on those gene names we want to use to label the plot.</p>

<p>Functional analysis tools are useful in interpreting resulting DGE gene lists from RNAseq, and fall into three main types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Over-representation analysis</li>

<p>To determine whether any GO terms are over-represented in a significant gene list, the probability of the observed proportion of genes associated with a specific term is compared to the probability of the background set of genes belonging to the same term. This statistical test is known as the "hypergeometric test".</p>

<p>To perform the over-representation analysis, we need a list of background genes and a list of significant genes. For our background dataset we will use all genes tested for differential expression (all genes in our results table). For our significant gene list we will use genes with p-adjusted values less than 0.05 (we could include a fold change threshold too if we have many DE genes).</p>

<p><strong>enrichment GO plot</strong></p>
<p>The next plot is the enrichment GO plot, which shows the relationship between the top 50 most significantly enriched GO terms (padj.), by grouping similar terms together. The color represents the p-values relative to the other displayed terms (brighter red is more significant) and the size of the terms represents the number of genes that are significant from our list.</p>
<p>This plot is useful because it serves to collapse the GO terms into functional categories by showing the overlap between GO terms.</p>

The size of the GO terms reflects the pvalues of the terms, with the more significant terms being larger. This plot is particularly useful for hypothesis generation in identifying genes that may be important to several of the most affected processes.</p>

<p>GSEA uses the entire list of log2 fold changes from all genes. It is based on looking for enrichment of genesets among the large positive or negative fold changes. Thus, rather than setting an arbitrary threshold to identify ‘significant genes’, all genes are considered in the analysis. The gene-level statistics from the dataset are aggregated to generate a single pathway-level statistic and statistical significance of each pathway is reported.</p>
<p>Extract and name the fold changes:</p>

<p>80%, that's very good, especially because we are using two different GO enrichment methods, over-representation analysis and GSEA. The overlap between these enrichment and the ones using the other GO enrichment tools will be very small because of the differences in the GO annotation libraries.</p>
<p>Now to set up the results for viewing in a network, we use the function <code>visSetup</code>, which creates a set of nodes and edges in the network, where nodes are GO terms (node size proportional to FDR score) and edges represent the overlap between GO terms (proportional to edge width). This network analysis is based on <a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>, an open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://genemania.org/">GeneMANIA</a>. GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data curated from the literature. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/">ReviGO</a>. Revigo is an online GO enrichment tool that allows you to copy-paste your significant gene list and your background gene list. The output is a visualization of enriched GO terms in a hierarchical tree.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a>. AmiGO is the current official web-based set of tools for searching and browsing the Gene Ontology database.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp">DAVID</a>. The fold enrichment is defined as the ratio of the two proportions; one is the proportion of genes in your list belong to certain pathway, and the other is the proportion of genes in the background information (i.e., universe genes) that belong to that pathway.</p></li>
