<p>To determine whether any GO terms are over-represented in a significant gene list, the probability of the observed proportion of genes associated with a specific term is compared to the probability of the background set of genes belonging to the same term. This statistical test is known as the âhypergeometric testâ.</p>

<p>To perform the over-representation analysis, we need a list of background genes and a list of significant genes. For our background dataset we will use all genes tested for differential expression (all genes in our results table). For our significant gene list we will use genes with p-adjusted values less than 0.05 (we could include a fold change threshold too if we have many DE genes).</p>

<p><strong>enrichment GO plot</strong></p>
<p>The next plot is the enrichment GO plot, which shows the relationship between the top 50 most significantly enriched GO terms (padj.), by grouping similar terms together. The color represents the p-values relative to the other displayed terms (brighter red is more significant) and the size of the terms represents the number of genes that are significant from our list.</p>
<p>This plot is useful because it serves to collapse the GO terms into functional categories by showing the overlap between GO terms.</p>

<p>Finally, the category netplot shows the relationships between the genes associated with the top five most significant GO terms and the fold changes of the significant genes associated with these terms (color). The size of the GO terms reflects the pvalues of the terms, with the more significant terms being larger. This plot is particularly useful for hypothesis generation in identifying genes that may be important to several of the most affected processes.</p>

<p>GSEA uses the entire list of log2 fold changes from all genes. It is based on looking for enrichment of genesets among the large positive or negative fold changes. Thus, rather than setting an arbitrary threshold to identify âsignificant genesâ, all genes are considered in the analysis. The gene-level statistics from the dataset are aggregated to generate a single pathway-level statistic and statistical significance of each pathway is reported.</p>
<p>Extract and name the fold changes:</p>

<p>Next we need to order the fold changes in decreasing order. To do this weâll use the <code>sort()</code> function, which takes a vector as input. This is in contrast to Tidyverseâs <code>arrange()</code>, which requires a data frame.</p>

<p>80%, thatâs very good, especially because we are using two different GO enrichment methods, over-representation analysis and GSEA. The overlap between these enrichment and the ones using the other GO enrichment tools will be very small because of the differences in the GO annotation libraries.</p>
<p>Now to set up the results for viewing in a network, we use the function <code>visSetup</code>, which creates a set of nodes and edges in the network, where nodes are GO terms (node size proportional to FDR score) and edges represent the overlap between GO terms (proportional to edge width). This network analysis is based on <a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>, an open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://genemania.org/">GeneMANIA</a>. GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data curated from the literature. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/">ReviGO</a>. Revigo is an online GO enrichment tool that allows you to copy-paste your significant gene list and your background gene list. The output is a visualization of enriched GO terms in a hierarchical tree.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a>. AmiGO is the current official web-based set of tools for searching and browsing the Gene Ontology database.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp">DAVID</a>. The fold enrichment is defined as the ratio of the two proportions; one is the proportion of genes in your list belong to certain pathway, and the other is the proportion of genes in the background information (i.e., universe genes) that belong to that pathway.</p></li>
