<p>Functional analysis tools are useful in interpreting resulting DGE gene lists from RNAseq, and fall into three main types:</p>

<p>To determine whether any GO terms are over-represented in a significant gene list, the probability of the observed proportion of genes associated with a specific term is compared to the probability of the background set of genes belonging to the same term. This statistical test is known as the "hypergeometric test".</p>

<p>To perform the over-representation analysis, we need a list of background genes and a list of significant genes. For our background dataset we will use all genes tested for differential expression (all genes in our results table). For our significant gene list we will use genes with p-adjusted values less than 0.05 (we could include a fold change threshold too if we have many DE genes).</p>

<p><strong>enrichment GO plot</strong></p>
<p>The next plot is the enrichment GO plot, which shows the relationship between the top 50 most significantly enriched GO terms (padj.), by grouping similar terms together. The color represents the p-values relative to the other displayed terms (brighter red is more significant) and the size of the terms represents the number of genes that are significant from our list.</p>
<p>This plot is useful because it serves to collapse the GO terms into functional categories by showing the overlap between GO terms.</p>

<p>Finally, the category netplot shows the relationships between the genes associated with the top five most significant GO terms and the fold changes of the significant genes associated with these terms (color). The size of the GO terms reflects the pvalues of the terms, with the more significant terms being larger. This plot is particularly useful for hypothesis generation in identifying genes that may be important to several of the most affected processes.</p>

<p>GSEA uses the entire list of log2 fold changes from all genes. It is based on looking for enrichment of genesets among the large positive or negative fold changes. Thus, rather than setting an arbitrary threshold to identify ‘significant genes’, all genes are considered in the analysis. The gene-level statistics from the dataset are aggregated to generate a single pathway-level statistic and statistical significance of each pathway is reported.</p>
<p>Extract and name the fold changes:</p>

<p>80%, that's very good, especially because we are using two different GO enrichment methods, over-representation analysis and GSEA. The overlap between these enrichment and the ones using the other GO enrichment tools will be very small because of the differences in the GO annotation libraries.</p>
<p>Now to set up the results for viewing in a network, we use the function <code>visSetup</code>, which creates a set of nodes and edges in the network, where nodes are GO terms (node size proportional to FDR score) and edges represent the overlap between GO terms (proportional to edge width). This network analysis is based on <a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>, an open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks.</p>

<p>This is one of the best visualizations available out of all the GO packages.</p>
<p>There are other gene sets available for GSEA analysis in clusterProfiler (Disease Ontology, Reactome pathways, etc.). In addition, it is possible to supply your own gene set GMT file, such as a GMT for MSigDB called c2.</p>
<p>** The C2 subcollection CGP: Chemical and genetic perturbations. Gene sets that represent expression signatures of genetic and chemical perturbations.**</p>

<li><p><a href="http://genemania.org/">GeneMANIA</a>. GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data curated from the literature.
